# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Task

In this week's homework, I was asked to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected using HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
